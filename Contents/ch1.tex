\chapter{Fundamental definitions}
\section{Manifolds}
The field of real numbers will be denoted by $\R$, and the field of complex numbers by $\C$; both are topological fields, with the familiar structures. The cartesin product of $\R$ with itself $n$ times. the usual euclidean $n$-space, will be denoted by $\R^n$; note that, as topological spaces, $\C$ and $\R^2$ can be identified with one another.

\begin{definition}
An $n$-dimensional {\it topological manifold} is a Hausdorff space $M$ such that every point $p\in M$ has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open cell in $\R^n$.
